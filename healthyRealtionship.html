       <p> <span>Note: This is a sample text.</span> As a person who wants to use social media as a way to advertise or promote a business or yourself, you should be aware of the tools you have online to make your social media campaigns go smoothly.

        First, I should mention Buffer, a tool that allows you to post on Twitter, Facebook, and other social media platforms in advance. It is also an analytical program that allows you to see what activity you got on certain posts and what time is the best to post. It also has a browser extension for easy posting. It has become a respected name in social media management.

        You know those long links you want to post on your profiles and that look awkward? You can shorten them effectively with Bit.ly.

           This comes in handy especially for Twitter with its 140-character limit.</p>

       <p> If you want to find business leads through social media, the application Oktopost focuses on just that. You can also manage your social media accounts through it. It is the most comprehensive business-to-business social media management system.

        If you are a Twitter fanatic, Tweepi is a great addition to your arsenal, as it targets users on Twitter that correspond to your Twitter account. For Twitter, finding users you should interact with on a daily basis is of utmost importance. Finding these users on one’s own is quite difficult, and this tool allows you to locate them easily.

        By the same token, Grytics scopes out targeted Facebook users that are interacting the most with your Facebook pages. Not only that, but this application allows to complete content analytics for your pages. You can see post statistics and trending topics within your Facebook.

        Ever wanted a caller ID for email, so to speak? Then Senders is your tool to use. It gives you a load of information on the people that are emailing you, including their social media following.

        These are just some of the tools you can use as a social media expert. Use them well to conquer the social media world!
